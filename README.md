Django Campaign Form Wizard

Overview

The Django Campaign Form Wizard is a multi-step form that allows anonymous users to progressively fill out campaign-related information. The form uses Django sessions to store data, ensuring that users can navigate between steps without losing progress. If a user exits and returns, previously entered data is restored.
